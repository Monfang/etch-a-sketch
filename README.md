##The Odin Project: Fundamentals - Etch-A-Sketch

This project included building a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch. 

Steps taken to achieve this outcome:

1. Add basic folders and files including a skeleton UI for the project
2. Code grid 16 x 16, on mouseover grid squares change colour to black
3. Create button to allow user to choose the number of grids, prompt only allows for numbers between 1 and 64
4. Create function that assigns a random colour to each grid square as it is passed over
5. Add responsiveness to grid on mobile
6. Change mouseenter to mouseover so that grid works on the mobile
7. Create button to randomise pen colour, default is black
